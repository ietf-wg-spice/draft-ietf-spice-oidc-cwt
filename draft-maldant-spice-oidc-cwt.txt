1.  Introduction

   OpenId Connect [OIDCCore] is an authentication standard including
   standard claims already in use for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519].
   CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) [RFC8392] have a claims registry, but do not
   include most of these claims.  This draft aims at unifying use of
   OIDC claims in JWTs and CWTs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Address claim

   In order to further reduce the size of this prevalent and large
   claim, we register integer labels for it.  We strictly map the
   definition of claims in Section 5.1.1 of [OIDCCore]: all the claims
   are optional and "formatted" can either be used instead or in
   addition of all the other fields.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document registers existing OpenID Connect standard claims
   already used in JSON Web Tokens [RFC7519] for use in CBOR Web Tokens
   [RFC8392] without changing their semantics.  The Security and Privacy
   Considerations respectively of Sections 16 and 17 of [OIDCCore] also
   apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   All claims defined in this document are placed in the (CBOR Web Token
   (CWT) Claims) [IANA.CWT.Claims] Registry (part of the eponymous
   registry group).  No new IANA registry is created.

   In case any of the suggested code points would have been claimed by
   the time of the Working Group last call, IANA is asked to assign
   Claim Key values from the 170-256 range.
