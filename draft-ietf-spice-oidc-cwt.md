# Introduction

OpenID Connect {{OpenID.Core}} is an authentication standard including standard claims already in use for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) {{?RFC7519}}. CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) {{!RFC8392}} have a claims registry, but do not include most of these claims. This draft aims at unifying use of OpenID Connect claims in JWTs and CWTs.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Address Claim

To further reduce the size of this prevalent and large claim, we register integer labels for it.
We strictly map the definition of claims in Section 5.1.1 of {{OpenID.Core}}: all the claims are optional and "formatted" can either be used instead or in addition of all the other fields.

# Security Considerations

This document registers existing OpenID Connect standard claims already used in JSON Web Tokens {{?RFC7519}} for use in CBOR Web Tokens {{!RFC8392}} without changing their semantics. The Security and Privacy Considerations respectively of Sections 16 and 17 of {{OpenID.Core}} also apply.

# IANA Considerations

All claims defined in this document are placed in the (CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims) {{IANA.CWT.Claims}} Registry (part of the eponymous registry group). No new IANA registry is created.

In case any of the suggested code points would have been claimed by the time the IESG approves the document for publication as an RFC, IANA is asked to assign Claim Key values from the 170-256 range.
